#summary How to create a custom dump file for the use in DSwiki
#labels Featured

==Download==

Download a compressed XML dump from http://download.wikimedia.org/.

E.g. for the german Wikipedia, download http://dumps.wikimedia.org/dewiki/latest/dewiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2. In my experience, _latest_ does not necessarily mean latest. Better go up one directory and check each labeled folder separately. You always need the ...-pages-articles.xml.bz2 version! The others files do not include the necessary data, or have too much data in them.

==Reindexing the file==

Download http://dswiki.googlecode.com/files/dswiki-indexer-1.0.zip and unpack it into the same directory that contains the article file.

Under Windows, run {{{indexer.exe <filename>}}} from the command line, under Linux execute {{{./indexer <filename>}}}. After the indexing process, you should have at least these five files (additional files will be created if the source files is too big):
  * articles.ifo
  * articles.dba
  * articles.idx
  * articles.ao1
  * articles.ao2

==Install==

For every file, change "articles" into a better name for your dump. Copy all files into the root directory of your flash card.
